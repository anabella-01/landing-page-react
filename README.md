# React + TypeScript + Vite

Hello! I created this responsive landing page as a practice exercise after learning the basics of the React library and using TailwindCSS for styling, based on a Figma design.
Through this project, I’ve discovered more about how I feel confident writing my code and structuring the project in a way that's readable for both myself and others.
